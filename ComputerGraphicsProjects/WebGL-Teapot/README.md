This folder contains two assignments from CSCI 4611 at the University of MN - Twin Cities. 

For the first project we created 3-dimensional renderings of a super-quadric and a teapot.
Both were drawn with lines to create a wireframe appearance. The teapot was generated using 
a set of control points for Bezier surface patches.

For the second project we extended the first project to implement illumination modeling
on the same set of objects, now drawn using a triangle mesh.Illumination modeling was achieved 
using the Phong model. We also implemented perspective projection.

*NOTE* I did not extend my own code from project 1 for project 2, but rather extended code 
provided by a TA. My code from project 1 was lacking a few features, so this is why there
are some style differences between the two projects.
